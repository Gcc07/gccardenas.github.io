## Top Ten Numbers One through Ten (1 is best)
1. **1**: Can't go wrong with number 1
2. **2**: Goated math number
3. **3**: Triangles are goated
4. **9**: Striving for greatness, tryna be a 10; Knows his flaws, and his strengths
5. **7**: Just a great number in general
6. **5**: Pretty good, counting by 5's is goated
7. **8**: Not horrible, has some uses. Is a nice doubled version of 4. Could've been better.
8. **6**: Mid number, just after halfway between 1 and 10
9. **10**: Once you make it, you fake. 10 is to good to be true
10. **4**: Mid number, outside of the goated trio

## Goated Links
- [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/): Youtube has been an important part of my life for a long time. I have watched many people, many videos, and grown up on the platform. It is a good learning resource, but also a good entertainment outlet.
- [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/): Steam has provided me with video games (not necessarily for free) for a long time. I have never had any issues with their services, and they keep things clean and tidy for me without me having to constantly find 3rd party services to get games from.
- [Weather](https://weather.com/): It doesn't need any introduction. I gotta know the weather, I check it.
