        <h1>My name is Gabe.</h1>
        <p>
        I am a student at Wake Early College,
        who enjoys sleeping, eating, and spending my time how I like.
        I run Track, Indoor Track, and Cross Country 
        for Green Hope High School, and I enjoy
        playing video games in my free time.

        My favorite color is orange, and my favorite
        food is chinese takeout. I like learning about
        the world, like music, history, and people, and
        religion. I like watching movies, shows, YouTube,
        instagram reels, and any other form of content. 
        I'm not a huge reader,
        but I try and keep myself updated with whats going
        on in the world.

        I come from a soccer family, even though I'm a runner.
        My parents both played soccer in high school, and my older
        brother plays division one in college. On the topic of
        college, I want
        to study computer science, programming, or some other IT 
        Degree. Ironically, my best subject is english. I'm not 
        bad at math, I just lose focus pretty quickly. I think 
        in the future I want to be a software developer. Ever since I
        was a kid I have always liked solving problems. I'm pretty creative,
        and I find creating solutions to complex issues interesting.
        I still get bored pretty quickly though, so whatever I'm doing
        needs to interest me for me to do it properly.
